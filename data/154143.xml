On 20 Dec. he took a party of 200 horse and dragoons to beat up the enemy quarters, and although outnumbered and forced to withdraw, inflicted heavy damage first. In Nov. 1643 the royalists besieging Gloucester, through an old friend, Edward Stanford, attempted to bribe Backhouse to betray the city, who strung them along for ten weeks, distracting the royalists from other strategies and almost leading them into a trap. He later produced an account of the plot to vindicate himself, <emph type="i">A True Relation of a Wicked Plot intended and still on Foot against the City of Gloster</emph> (1644) (reprinted in <emph type="i">Bibliotheca</emph>, 283-324), published at the Commons’ direction. In Aug. 1644 he commanded three troops of horse at the battle of Redmarley (Worcestershire), where the royalist Colonel Mynne was killed. In Apr. 1645 Backhouse, by now a major, was mortally wounded when Prince Rupert’s army attacked Ledbury. In June 1645 Massey wrote to the Gloucester authorities commending Backhouse’s widow and children to their care.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Peachey and Turton, <emph type="i">Fall of the West</emph>, 6.629; <emph type="i">Bibliotheca</emph>, xciv, ciii-iv, cvii, 68-87, 283-324, 111-2, 143-4.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Gloucestershire</emph></td></tr>

The Baintons were amongst the wealthiest and most prominent non-peerage families of Wiltshire.<br/>His son Edward was MP for Devizes in the Short and Long Parliaments and also represented either Devizes or Calne in two of the Protectorate parliaments and in the Convention and Restoration parliaments. In the 1642 listing of the earl of Essex’s Army he is shown as captain of a troop of horse, though his military career seems to have been fairly limited. By the latter half of the 1640s he was one of the leading political Presbyterians and an opponent of the New Model Army and he had effectively withdrawn from the House even before Pride’s Purge. Despite his election to two of the Protectorate Parliaments, he was largely out of office during the 1650s.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Peacock, <emph type="i">Army lists</emph>, 54; <emph type="i">HoP: The Commons, 1660-1690</emph>, 1. 607-9.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Earl of Essex</emph></td></tr>

Having served as an infantry officer in western England during the opening months of the civil war, including for a time as lieutenant-colonel in Thomas Stevens’s regiment of foot based in and garrisoning Bristol, by spring 1643 he had entered Waller’s Army and his regiment of foot, at the end of the year succeeding Ramsey as the regiment’s lieutenant-colonel. He fought at Cheriton and Cropredy Bridge in 1644, wounded at the former and captured (though quickly exchanged) at the latter. He ended his time in Waller’s Army fighting in the West, including in the relief of Taunton. With the resignation of Waller and the disbanding of his regiments in spring 1645, Baker moved on and slightly later in the year he became Major in the regiment of reformadoes commanded by Colonel Sanderson.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Spring, <emph type="i">Waller’s army</emph>, 154; Peacock, Army lists, 30; Peachey and Turton, <emph type="i">Fall of the West</emph>, 6.646.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Bristol; Waller (Southern Association); Gloucestershire</emph></td></tr>

On 27 Nov. 1645 he defended his men’s refusal to march for want of adequate pay and quarters, having voted unanimously to disobey Sir William Brereton’s orders, ‘saying they were infinitely injured, that inferior men were countenanced and laid in secure quarters, have their pay constantly paid, while they are constantly put upon out quarters, having not wherewithal to cover their nakedness nor a penny money in their pockets’ (Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 2. 275). By 25 Dec. 1645 Baker and his reformados were stationed at Whitchurch, Shropshire However, on 27 Dec. Brereton wrote to Baker reproaching him for leading the reformados back into Cheshire. Baker blamed uncertain orders while reporting that 40 of his horses were lame for want of shoeing (his being one of three cavalry units then quartered at Whitchurch, together numbering 600-700 men). On 28 Dec. Baker further reported that lack of pay ‘hath so incensed the gents [troopers] that if my life lay at stake I know not how to appease them’. Since Brereton had promised to do what he could for them, ‘I have found such an alteration that either it is that they are jealous of neglect of their officers in not moving you, or else obstinate in respect that they themselves said in my face that they were more disrespected than the private troops belonging to your army.’ These troops (by which Dore suggests Baker meant the troops of horse raised by Cheshire landowners) received the regular pay and free quarter, denied the reformados (Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 2. 449-50).<br/>Serving under Brereton Baker is generally referred to as major, but may previously have been a lieutenant-colonel.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: TNA, SP28/224, ff. 76, 85); Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 2. 266, 275, 383, 434-7, 443, 446-8, 449-50, 453, 504, 511; Symonds, <emph type="i">Diary</emph>, 258.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Reformado; London; Cheshire</emph></td></tr>

<tr><td>Balfour, Sir William</td><td><emph type="b">Sir William Balfour </emph>(died 1660)<br/>Born probably in the 1570s, the son of Henry Balfour of Pitcallo, Fife. By the 1590s he was serving in Scottish units in the Dutch army and he continued in Dutch employ for most of the first quarter of the seventeenth century. In 1628, and at the king’s request, he joined the duke of Buckingham’s expedition to the Ile de Rhe, but he soon returned to continental warfare. However, he returned to England during the 1630s and served as a courtier, commissioner and emissary of Charles I and as lieutenant of the Tower.<br/>In the wake of the king’s two wars against the Scots, Balfour supported parliament in the civil war and, despite his age, had a distinguished military career. In Aug. 1642 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the horse under the earl of Bedford, with his own troop and regiment of horse, and at the head of a brigade of horse he performed very strongly at Edgehill, steadying the parliamentarian position and counter-attacking. Although he spent part of 1643 outside England for health reasons, he was back by spring 1644, when Essex sent him at the head of a brigade to support Waller in southern England, playing a prominent role at the battle of Cheriton. He was with Essex when the latter marched into the South West in summer 1644, though he with his own regiment of horse and other cavalry managed to cut their way out and elude capture. He rejoined Waller and played a leading role in the second battle of Newbury. Illness and old age, together with some suspicions of his loyalty due to his Scottish background, led to him effectively giving up command and leaving the army soon after. His regiment of horse was disbanded around the same time, in spring 1645. On 21 Jan. 1645, as the senior officers of the New Model were being discussed in the Commons, the House also asked the committee for regulating the armies ‘to consider of some fit Recompence to be conferred upon Sir Wm. Balfour in Acknowledgment of the faithful Services done by him to the Publick’ (<emph type="i">JHC</emph>, 4.26).<br/>He spent his last years in quiet retirement in London and died there a few weeks after the Restoration.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>; Peacock, <emph type="i">Army lists</emph>, 22, 47<emph type="i">.</emph><br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Earl of Essex; Waller (Southern Association)</emph></td></tr>

Elected to both the Short and Long Parliaments in 1640, where he was very active in criticising and opposing religious and other aspects of royal government. In 1642 he was a leading supporter of the Militia Ordinance and under the earl of Warwick served as one of parliament’s deputy-lieutenants in Essex.

<tr><td>Barton, Nathaniel</td><td><emph type="b">Nathaniel Barton</emph> (1615/16-1672/73)<br/>Son of Edmund Barton, rector of Broseley, Shropshire. Nathaniel matriculated from New Inn Hall, Oxford, in 1634, graduated BA in 1638 and proceeding MA in 1641 and BD in 1649. Chaplain to Sir Thomas Burdett and MP for Derbyshire in the Nominated Assembly and the first Protectorate parliament.<br/>According to one source, on 13 July 1643 Barton and Captain Hope, ‘two martial ministers of Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire coming to Peterborough, break open the Vestery and take away a Fair Crimson Satten Table Cloth and several other things’ (<emph type="i">Calamy Revised</emph>, 33). However, the date here is dubious. In late spring 1643 Barton was major in Robert Haughton’s regiment of Derbyshire and Staffordshire foot at Burton-upon-Trent (of which Thomas Sanders was lieutenant-colonel), and was captured when the town fell to the royalists on 2 July.<br/>After his release, Sanders appointed him captain in the regiment of horse which he raised, of which Sanders was major and Sir John Gell colonel.<br/>Gell placed Barton in command of the garrison of Barton Blount, from where he could harass the royalists at Tutbury 3 miles away, and from there he reported to Sir William Brereton.<br/>Barton was, however, hostile to Gell, and in Mar. 1645 he was one of those godly Derbyshire captains of horse then serving with Brereton who were more in sympathy with the latter (who in turn described him and Captain Joseph Swetnam as ‘very reverend divines’ (Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 1.79), and who resented Gell starving their regiment of supply to force their return to Derbyshire. In Dec. 1645 he was one of the officers complaining against Gell to the committee of examinations. In 1645 he became captain in Richard Graves’s regiment of horse in the New Model Army, and in Mar. 1647 he contradicted the claims of another officer that the regiment was not discontented. After Graves was replaced as colonel by Adrian Scrope, Barton was promoted major, and commanded the regiment’s three troops at the battle of St Fagan’s (8 May 1648). He may have been back in the Midlands by the summer. He was present at the Army Council meetings in Nov. and Dec. 1648, and served in Scrope’s regiment of horse until its disbandment after Burford.<br/>On 2 Mar. 1650, as colonel, Barton was commissioned commander-in-chief of the Derbyshire militia horse and foot and seems to have served temporarily the following year as major of Thomas Sanders’s regiment of horse (previously Francis Thornhaugh’s) and fought in the Worcester campaign.<br/>A JP in 1650, and in Oct., when George Fox was arrested after having followed Barton in preaching at St Peter’s, Derby, Barton was one of the magistrates who examined him (his colleague Gervase Bennet was then the first to use the word ‘Quaker’ in relation to Fox).<br/>Barton was a JP in Derbyshire in the 1650s. A moderate in the Nominated Assembly, and a member of the first Protectorate parliament, he was appointed a commissioner for enquiring into the arrears of the excise in Dec. 1654.<br/>When Sanders was re-instated to the command of his regiment after the fall of Richard Cromwell, Barton became its major again until Monck placed other officers in their stead. Barton and Sanders were both arrested in late 1659, apparently for armed resistance; on 27 Dec. the restored Long Parliament ordered their release, and the same day Colonel Hacker released them. Barton was promptly authorized to disarm parliament’s enemies in Staffordshire and a place was found for him as major of Robert Swallow’s late regiment (now under Sanders).<br/>At the Restoration Barton was curate of Caldwell chapel, Stapenhill parish, Derbyshire, but was ejected in 1662. An informer in 1669 accused him of being privy to a conspiracy and described him as ‘Captaine or Major Barton formerly in Armes agt. the late King and a minister att the beginning of the warres…who purchased some of the King’s lands wch he hath lost and is highly discontented’ (<emph type="i">Calamy Revised</emph>, 33).<br/>He made his will on 30 Mar. 1672, leaving a wife (Sarah), two sons and four daughters; it was proved on 10 Nov. 1673.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Calamy Revised</emph>, 33; Woolrych, <emph type="i">Commonwealth</emph>, 121, 313, 384n., 410-11; Turbutt, <emph type="i">Derbyshire</emph>, 3. 1062, 1070, 1078, 1087, 1093, 1097, 1100, 1133, 1138; Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 1.79, 498, 524; Firth and Davies, <emph type="i">Regimental History</emph>, 1.103, 105, 107, 109, 114, 283-4, 288-90; <emph type="i">CSPD 1650</emph>, 504; Slack, ‘Gell and Sanders’, 137; <a href="http://www.theclergydatabase.org.uk">www.theclergydatabase.org.uk</a>; <emph type="i">HoP: The Commons, 1640-1660 </emph>(forthcoming); Wanklyn, <emph type="i">New Model Army</emph>, I, 63, 74, 84, 96, 108.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Derbyshire; Cheshire; New Model Army</emph></td></tr>

Six days later Barton was present under the earl of Denbigh at the taking of Cholmondeley Castle. However, Barton may then have transferred to Denbigh’s command and returned with him to London (Denbigh had found Myddelton’s cavalry more useful and less mutinous than Myddelton’s infantry), for in letters from mid Wales dated 25 Sept. and 2 Oct. Myddelton begged the Committee of Both Kingdoms to send Barton and Sir William Myddelton to him with a reinforcement of horse.

He possibly was an apprentice in the Leeds cloth trade before the outbreak of the civil war, whereupon he joined the Fairfaxes’ army, serving as a captain in Lord Fairfax’s foot regiment and later in 1643 raising a troop of horse. He fought under the Fairfaxes at Adwalton Moor and Marston Moor and then in 1646-7 served as a captain in John Lambert’s northern brigade, in a regiment of horse which was on the New Model Army payroll; by 1649 he was Lambert’s and the brigade’s financial agent in London, in which capacity he became wealthy and acquired significant property as well as maintaining an extensive correspondence with Lambert and other contacts, the survival of which provides a major source for army politics and financial dealings in the 1650s. As a prot&#xe9;g&#xe9; of Lambert, he was in favour during the opening years of the Protectorate, serving – despite some local opposition – as MP for Leeds in the first and second Protectorate Parliaments. With the kingship controversy and the fall of Lambert, Baynes, too, lost most of his offices and either quit or was removed from the army. After a brief return to favour on Lambert’s coat-tails in 1659, he lost influence and some (though not all) of his offices and property at the Restoration. Despite rumours of financial hardship during the 1660s and a period under arrest on suspicion of treason, he retained considerable land, property and business connections at the time of his death.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>; D.

A quarrelsome figure, who fought a duel with a fellow MP in Aug. 1641, he was the first commander of the Wiltshire forces but fell out with Sir Edward Hungerford, each in turn arresting the other. Parliament decided in favour of Hungerford, who was appointed commander-in-chief of the Wiltshire forces of two regiments of horse and 1,000 dragoons on 31 Jan. 1643. Baynton withdrew, and in June fled to the Isle of Wight, where he opened negotiations for a pardon from the king. He was brought up to London and briefly a prisoner, but by June 1644 had resumed his seat in the Commons. In 1645 his house at Bromham was destroyed by the royalists.

In spring 1644 he and at least part of his regiment were ordered to join the earl of Denbigh in supporting Gloucester, though Behre seems to have fallen out with Denbigh; indeed, around the same time he was involved in a bitter dispute with John Middleton, with accusations and counter-accusations in print (<emph type="i">Declaration of Commissary Generall Hans Behr</emph>, countered by <emph type="i">There Hath Bin a Paper</emph>). He rejoined Essex in summer 1644, his regiment at its muster comprising 5 troops and 371 troopers, and so took part in the doomed march into the South West, cutting his way out of Cornwall with most of the horse. In autumn 1644 he left England and returned to the continent; thus he was probably not present at, and no longer in command of his regiment when it fought in, the second battle of Newbury. Without him, his regiment became increasingly fragmented and mutinous; in early 1645 most of its foreign troops were dismissed and the remaining English troops sent West to support Massey where they were absorbed into his regiment of horse.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>; TNA, SP28/9/65, SP28/12/328; Symonds, <emph type="i">Diary</emph>, 73; Stoyle, <emph type="i">Soldiers and strangers</emph>, 88-90, 95-6, 102, 105-7, 119-20, 126-7, 131, 138, 201, 213-4; <emph type="i">CSPD, 1644</emph>, 97.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Earl of Essex; Waller (Southern Association)</emph></td></tr>

Monck reinstated Bethell as colonel of Lambert’s regiment of horse, recommending him as ‘a person of great interest in the northerne parts, and often in the time of the Protector Oliver was offred commission but refused it, and the regiment was much of it his before Lambert had it, and hee is of unquestionable courage and faithfullnes, which hee eminently testified in the late interrupcion by rasing the county for yow’ (Firth and Davies, <emph type="i">Reg</emph><emph type="i">imental</emph><emph type="i"></emph><emph type="i">H</emph><emph type="i">istory</emph>, 1, 261). When Lambert escaped from the Tower of London in Apr. 1660 Bethell forestalled a rising in York by arresting potential ringleaders. He was MP for Hedon in the parliaments of 1660, 1661-79 and in the first Exclusion Parliament. He was listed as a court dependant in 1664, but by 1679 was a member of the Green Ribbon Club and reckoned by Shafestbury as ‘worthy’.

Walter’s maternal uncle, who acted much like a guardian to his nephews after their father’s death, was the royalist Sir Henry Slingsby, baronet (1602-58). Walter’s younger brother was Slingsby Bethel, the future republican and radical Whig. Walter was related to the parliamentarian Bethells of the East Riding.<br/>By Oct. 1643 a captain of horse at Hull, where he distinguished himself; Bethell's troop also took part in the attack on Bridlington in Jan. 1644. That Apr. he joined Hugh Bethell’s regiment of horse as a captain, and remained until June 1645. He later joined the New Model Army, and in 1646 was a captain in Colonel John Butler’s regiment of horse. In Apr. 1647 he was signatory to the regiment's petition protesting against Butler's proposal to persuade his men to volunteer for Ireland, leaving the question of their arrears to parliament. When Butler left the army in June 1647 Bethell was promoted to major under the regiment’s new Colonel Thomas Horton. In May 1648 Bethell commanded the parliamentarian right wing at the battle of St Fagan’s. In Aug. 1649 Bethell resigned and about half the regiment disbanded rather than be posted to Ireland.

Elder brother of Samuel Birch.<br/>By 1633 Birch was a Bristol wine merchant, and in 1642 he commanded a company of volunteers active in the defence of the city in 1643 (helping foil a royalist plot). With the fall of the city, he sold up and raised a regiment of foot as lieutenant-colonel to Sir Arthur Hesilrige in Waller’s army, and fought with distinction at Alton and Arundel Castle in Dec. 1643 (he was badly wounded at the latter) and in 1644 at Alresford, the siege of Winchester, and at Cropredy. Hesilrige converted the regiment into a dragoon regiment and Birch was commissioned colonel of a Kentish regiment. Waller commanded the regiment to march to Weymouth in Sept. 1644, but following Essex’s defeat Birch was ordered to take it to Plymouth, which had been stripped of men for Essex’s march into the west. He led his men in a strong counter-assault against two outworks captured by the royalists in the night in Jan. 1645. With Fairfax’s advance into the west his regiment marched from Plymouth and helped the New Model Army to take Bridgwater and Bath. He was appointed governor of Bath, then Bristol. After he took Hereford on 18 Dec. 1645, he was appointed governor there. In summer 1646 he besieged Goodrich and Raglan Castles.

Elder brother of Samuel Birch.<br/>By the 1630s he was a wine merchant working in Bristol. From the outbreak of the civil war he was captain in a unit of Bristol volunteers and as such probably took part in its defence when it was stormed. He left Bristol and lost much of his property when the town fell to the king in summer 1643. Later that summer he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel in Sir Arthur Hesilrige’s regiment of foot, and was in effect commander of the regiment in Heselrige’s absence; as such, he saw action at Alton, Arundel Castle (where he was badly wounded) and elsewhere during winter 1643-4. He recovered to fight at the battles of Cheriton and Cropredy Bridge in spring and summer 1644. In July he was promoted to colonel and given command of a new regiment of foot to be raised in Kent. Birch and his new regiment campaigned under Waller in the West and he was sent to Plymouth by boat to reinforce the beleaguered parliamentarian garrison, where his men remained until spring or summer 1645. Part or all of the regiment then supported the New Model Army campaign in the West, including the capture of Bridgwater and Bristol; in due course Birch was appointed governor of Bristol and Bath. In autumn 1645 Birch led part of his regiment to campaign in the southern Marches, the high point of which was his daring capture of Hereford mid-winter and amidst heavy snow; he was appointed governor of Hereford Castle. He took part in the battle of Stow in Mar. 1646 and then helped to mop up other Marcher strongholds, such as Raglan, Goodrich and Ludlow.<br/>In the mid-1640s he acquired a property in Herefordshire – his enemies accused him of corruption and greed – and was soon engaged in a local power struggle with the Harley family. Returned as an MP to the Long Parliament around the same time, he effectively left the army in the later 1640s and focused on building up his position within Herefordshire, acquiring more property and local offices. He was secluded and imprisoned at Pride’s Purge and elected to but excluded from the second Protectorate Parliament. He was out of favour and under suspicion of royalist leanings during the 1650s, though he retained local office and was elected to and active in the third Protectorate parliament. He returned to favour and higher office at the Restoration and sat in most parliaments of the Restoration era, down to his death.<br/>His civil war military career can be reconstructed in part from the later and rather self-serving and laudatory biographical sketch which was written by his secretary but which was evidently heavily dependent upon Birch’s own account, memories and perspectives.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph><emph type="i">.</emph><br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Waller; </emph><emph type="i">Waller (Southern Association</emph><emph type="i">)</emph><emph type="i"></emph></td></tr>

In May 1648 Samuel was signatory to the Presbyterian, anti-New Model Army ‘Engagement or Declaration of the Officers and Souldiers of the County Palatine of Lancaster’. He later relinquished his commission: ‘when he found things were run to extremity, he quitted it and returned to Oxford’ (where he had matriculated from Brasenose College in Mar. 1637). He was created MA from St Mary Hall and made chaplain of Corpus Christi College in 1655. In 1658 he was appointed to second portion of Bampton vicarage, Oxfordshire.

On 21 Oct. 1623 Thomas married Alice (died 1697), eldest daughter of Thomas Brooke of Norton, Cheshire.<br/>Birch was appointed by parliament a deputy-lieutenant in Lancashire in Mar. 1642 and in June received a commission to raise a regiment of foot. In mid-July he helped oppose Lord Strange’s attempt to secure Manchester for the king; according to royalist accounts, when the rain put out the musketeers’ matches and the pikemen were unwilling to advance, Birch ignominiously hid under a cart. In Oct. he joined in the siege of Manchester and also took possession of Townley Hall.<br/>Birch was an officer, first a captain, then, in Dec. 1642, promoted major, in Ralph Assheton senior’s regiment of Lancashire foot. He was at the storming of Preston in Feb.1643, and with the force occupying Lancaster. That Mar. Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, promoted Birch with the colonelcy of a regiment of foot. From 1644 he was an active and radical member of the Lancashire county committee. On 7 Sept. 1649 Birch was appointed governor of Liverpool, and on 24 May 1650 was commissioned colonel of a regiment of foot in the Lancashire militia. In 1651 he commanded the force that occupied the Isle of Man. As a politician, in 1649 Birch was elected Recruiter MP for Liverpool, was a member of the Nominated Assembly, and was elected MP for Liverpool in the first and second Protectorate Parliaments (and was possibly MP for Clitheroe in the third in 1659). An active committeeman and sequestrator, Birch became a leading figure in the county as more moderate leading gentry withdrew, and was a firm supporter of the regimes of the 1650s. ‘With the collapse of the traditional leadership within the county community of Lancashire Birch established a remarkable ascendancy, underpinned by parliamentary, administrative, and military office.’ (<emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>). An Independent in the early 1650s, Birch veered towards Presbyterianism by the later 1650s.

Samuel was Robert Blake’s brother and later commanded a company in a regiment in which Robert was lieutenant-colonel. The entry seems much more likely to imply that Robert is the captain. This would also be consistent with the account of the regiment in Peachey and Turton. Blake, unlike some other captains, only appears once, very early in the records, and Peachey and Turton suggest that the regiment may have effectively disbanded in spring in 1643, and then reformed in Apr./May. By Mar. 1643, Robert Blake was in Bristol, where he was a signatory to the death warrants of those who had plotted to betray the city to the royalists, and during the siege defended Prior’s Hill Fort.

He led the infantry at the storming of Malmesbury (25 May 1644). By 29 May he had been promoted lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, and on that day the Commons voted that he be commissioned colonel of that regiment.

Prominent in the parliamentarian cause in Cheshire throughout the civil war, Booth was however more moderate than and often at odds with parliament’s county boss, Sir William Brereton. As such, although a colonel of a regiment of foot, his active military role was quite limited, but he was governor of Nantwich for much of the war and he did play a prominent part in 1645 in the siege of Chester. He resigned his commission towards the end of the war and became MP for Cheshire, though he was excluded at Pride’s Purge. He was returned for the county again to the first and second Protectorate Parliaments, though again excluded from the second. He represented Lancashire in the third Protectorate Parliament (Richard Cromwell’s) and, having failed to regain his seat when the Rump returned, in summer 1659 he led a failed rising in Cheshire. He returned to office and to favour at the Restoration and was raised to the peerage as first Baron Delamer, though he became increasingly disillusioned by and opposed to some of the policies of Charles II.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph><emph type="i">; </emph>Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter b</emph><emph type="i">ooks,</emph> 1. 329, 371.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph></td></tr>

He became a captain in Richard Holland’s regiment of foot, and was reportedly the first to scale the walls of Preston during the assault on 13 Feb. 1643. Booth became colonel of a regiment raised in July 1643 to secure Warrington and the surrounding area (he was governor of the town in 1645 and possibly before) and to support Sir William Brereton in Cheshire. Debenture evidence shows both foot and horse were under Booth's command. During 1644, in Jan. he fought at the battle of Nantwich, and in Aug. his foot helped put to flight the royalists at Ormskirk. Booth's regiment joined in both sieges of Lathom House, and in Dec. 1645 he accepted its surrender. In Feb. 1646 Booth was a commissioner for the surrender of Chester, and his regiment later served under Thomas Mytton in North Wales. Even during the first civil war Booth’s parliamentarian commitment was doubted. During the 1650s he was deeply involved in royalist conspiracies and in 1659 joined George Booth’s Rising.

The story – in its fullest form describing Derby killing Bootle in cold blood whilst soldiers pinioned his arms – was an atrocity tale related by parliamentarian pamphleteers.

In the hostile account of the diarist Thomas Juxon, he was rapidly exchanged for an important royalist whom Essex had earlier begged parliament <emph type="i">not</emph> to exchange, and on his return brought propositions from the king, which he gave to Colonel Thomas Tyrrell who passed them on to Sir Philip Stapleton, ‘and so they were dispersed into the army without acquainting the parliament and contrary to the ordinances of war’. After this, Botteler was several times in the king’s quarters, it was claimed and afterwards both he and Aldrich, with their regtiments, ‘were commanded to several ports of importance, basely quitted them and run away, which produced our so great loss there’ [the surrender at Lostwithiel on 2 Sept. 1644] (Juxon, <emph type="i">Diary</emph>, 59).<br/>Botteler offered to stand trial for his actions and was sent up on his parole to London by Essex, ‘who declared that he had always esteem’d him as a stout Man, but would freely leave him to justice’ (Rushworth, <emph type="i">Historical collections</emph>, 7.7). On 27 Sept. the Commons referred the matter to Zouch Tate’s committee for the reformation of the Lord General’s Army; on 30 Sept. the House ordered that Botteler be committed to the Tower upon suspicion of betraying the army.<br/>Examinations taken before the Committee of Both Kingdoms on 3 Dec. 1644 were perhaps more ambiguous as to actual disloyalty, but damning as to his military conduct. Philip Skippon told how when Tyrrell read him the propositions that Botteler brought from the king’s army, he ‘told Colonel Tyrrel that they were not fit to be concealed; Colonel Tyrrel reply’d, that he understood as much, and that he had sent, or would send a Copy of them to Sir Philip Stapleton’ (Rushworth, <emph type="i">Historical collections, </emph>7.7). In the last fight, Botteler had withdrawn from the position he had been ordered to hold, claiming he could not keep above 200 men together. He had not been seriously attacked, and had let the royalists get between the parliamentarian army and Fowey: ‘the withdrawing from this Post was one of those things which necessitated them to enter into so sudden a Treaty’ (Rushworth, <emph type="i">Historical collections, </emph>7.7). Other witnesses (including Thomas Tyrrell) blamed him for the distribution of the propositions and supported the allegation that he had given up the post assigned to him, reporting that he had claimed that there was too much ground for his men to hold, and similarly concluding that his defection had led directly to the surrender of the infantry.<br/>In Feb. 1645 the Commons resolved that he be referred to trial at a council of war for deserting his posts, whilst the suspicion of his being an incendiary and the words he was alleged to have spoken against parliament should be further investigated. Nevertheless, despite Essex in the Lords moving that Botteler and John Dalbier be brought to trial, and Botteler himself demanding to be tried, the Commons chose to leave him in the Tower untried and in want for himself, his wife and children. The Commons finally bailed him on 29 July 1645, in response to a further request from the Lords: ‘They desire to put you in mind of Colonel Boteler. He hath lain long a close Prisoner. He hath been twice plundered by the King’s Forces: They desire he may be brought to a speedy Tryal; or that you will take care he may be maintained in Prison, his Wife and himself being ready to starve’ (<emph type="i">JHC</emph>, 4.224).<br/>On 20 Oct. 1645 the Commons ordered that the report on Botteler be made the first business the following Saturday, but this did not happen; on 2 Dec. 1645 the House ordered the committee of accounts to cast up his accounts.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Peacock, <emph type="i">Army lists</emph>, 28, 81;<emph type="i"></emph>TNA, SP28/4/251; SP28/7/ 59, 291, 370, 385; SP28/9/174; SP28/10/153; Juxon, <emph type="i">Diary</emph>, 58-60; <emph type="i">HMC, Sixth report</emph>, 37; Rushworth, <emph type="i">Historical collections, </emph>7.7; <emph type="i">JHC</emph>, 4.60, 61, 162, 224, 316, 363; <emph type="i">JHL</emph>, 7.77, 341, 439, 517.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Earl of Essex</emph></td></tr>

His father was a JP and five times MP for Staffordshire (see <emph type="i">HoP: The Commons, 1604-1629</emph>, 3.281-3) whilst his mother was a sister of Sir William Brereton’s second wife. He married Mary, daughter and heir of Robert Millward of Bradlow Ashe, Derbyshire, esquire.<br/>Captain of foot, 1642-4; Colonel, 1644-7; governor of Leek, Staffordshire, 1644-6.<br/>Bowyer served in various Staffordshire operations in 1643, including alongside Sir William Brereton’s force at Hopton Heath (19 Mar. 1643).<br/>By Feb. 1645 he was serving under Sir William Brereton, who sent him as commander of a force of about 400 Staffordshire and Cheshire horse and 500 Staffordshire foot to join with Mytton’s forces at Wem and Oswestry and took part under the latter in the taking of Shrewsbury.<br/>In the politics of the Staffordshire county committee, Bowyer was strongly pro-Brereton, and in Oct. 1645 was that faction’s choice for commander of the Staffordshire horse sent to serve under his kinsman at the siege of Chester. He became one of Brereton’s trusted officers. In Jan. 1646 Brereton ordered him into Staffordshire with the Warwickshire and Staffordshire horse to counter royalist movements there. In Mar. Brereton sent him with a small detachment to take Tutbury Castle. ‘Bowyer’s forces apparently comprised three under-strength foot companies from the Moorlands, and two small foot companies from the trained bands: in all, 220 foot. In addition, Bowyer could call on some horse as required, and 130 Derbyshire foot’ (Carr and Atherton, <emph type="i">Brereton Staffs</emph><emph type="i">.</emph>, 35). Bowyer’s own company was just 35 men strong. Bowyer had to deal not only with the royalists, but with the more generous surrender terms that Sir John Gell was offering the garrison (his ‘private plots’, as Bowyer called them), but the castle surrendered to Brereton and Bowyer on 20 Apr. In early May Bowyer was ordered to oversee the slighting of the castle.<br/>Brereton backed Bowyer strongly in the Recruiter election for Staffordshire: he was elected MP on 13 Aug. 1646 and sat until his seclusion at Pride’s Purge; in 1651 he was ordered to be arrested as ‘disaffected and dangerous’.<br/>He was elected MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1656 (when he was not allowed to take his seat) and in 1660. Active in the Convention Parliament, his commitment to the restoration of the king was rewarded with a knighthood and baronetcy; deputy-lieutenant in Staffordshire in Aug. 1660-1, and sheriff 1662-3.<br/>Bowyer was buried at Biddulph, Staffordshire, on 18 July 1666.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Vis.

Eldest son of Henry Bradshaw (died 1654) of Marple Hall and Wibersley, Cheshire, and Catherine Winnington (died 1604) of Offerton, Cheshire. The elder brother of John Bradshaw, the regicide. Henry married (1) Mary, daughter of Bernard Wells of Stoke, Derbyshire, and (2) Anne, daughter, of George Bowdon of Bowdon.<br/>Henry Bradshaw was, by his own account, an officer in the Cheshire forces: ‘Captain of a Company of foote souldiers in the regiment of Collonell Robt. Duckenfeild, in actuall service for the parlt. from the 13th. Day of May, 1643, to the 10th. day of March the same year being 301 dayes; he was Serjeant Major to the foresaid regiment from the said 10th. of March, by vertue of a Commission from the late Ferdinando Lord Fairfax until the 3rd. day of Feb., 1645 [/46], being 695 dayes, and was in both these commaunds in actuall service’, and had not received more than &#xa3;50 in all for both offices (Earwaker, <emph type="i">East Cheshire</emph>, 62-3). During the second civil war Bradshaw (fruitlessly) attempted to raise a regiment for parliament in Macclesfield Hundred.<br/>On 22 Aug. 1650 Bradshaw was commissioned colonel of a militia regiment of foot in Cheshire. The regiment formed part of the Cheshire brigade that fought at the battle of Worcester, where he was slightly wounded.<emph type="i"></emph>In 1652 he sat on the court martial which tried the earl of Derby.<br/>In religion Bradshaw seems to have been a strict Presbyterian, signing the petition for establishing a Presbyterian structure in Cheshire in 1646. Of middling gentry class, he gained prominence with Sir William Brereton’s militant faction. He was one of the most active JPs in Cheshire 1646-59. In 1651 he prosecuted at Quarter Sessions one Joshua Gerrard for saying, ‘a strangr would not thinke hee the said Colonel Henry Bradshaw were a man of that eminency in the country, hee goeing soe plaine in apparell’ (Morrill, <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph>, 227).

However, he remained neutral, protesting to Booth that he had not acted against him and objecting to the search of his house for arms. Nevertheless, he advised Booth to desist, ‘and submit to the all-seeing decree and providence of or mercifull God’ (Morrill, <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph>, 312-3). As the rebellion collapsed Henry was one of those who advised Booth to appeal to parliament’s mercy.<br/>At the Restoration, Bradshaw was arrested for his part in Derby’s trial: his defence was that he had not constantly attended the court; that he had not signed the death warrant; that he had interceded with the president of the court and with his brother John for Derby’s life to be spared; and that he was a poor man with small estate and eleven children. He was released on bail after a month.<br/>Bradshaw died at Marple on 11 Mar. 1662, and was buried at Stockport four days later.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Earwaker, <emph type="i">East Cheshire</emph>, 2.61-2, 64-8; <emph type="i">CSPD, 1650</emph>, 507. 509; <emph type="i">Oxford DNB </emph>[under his brother John Bradshaw]; Morrill, <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph>, 52, 187, 188, 219-20, 224, 227, 235, 257, 258, 262, 264-288, 291-3, 295-9, 312-3, 323, 327-8; Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 1. 181-2, 325, 377-8, 330-1, 2. 487, 496-8; Carr and Atherton<emph type="i">, Brereton Staffs., </emph>170.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph></td></tr>

Jerome Sankey later certified in support of Richard’s claims, that when Sir Thomas Fairfax, from Leighton Buzzard, on 30 July 1647 ordered him to go to Cheshire, Brereton volunteered himself and his men ‘and ingaged himselfe, as farre as in him laye to observe what ever orders I should receive’ from Fairfax, and continued under Sankey’s command until his troop was disbanded on 9 Jan. 1648.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: BL, Harl. 2128, ff. 73r.-78r.; Carr and Atherton<emph type="i">, Brereton Staffs</emph><emph type="i">.</emph>, 58, 349.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Cheshire; Reformado</emph></td></tr>

He married (1) in 1623 Susanna, daughter of Sir George Booth of Dunham Massey, Cheshire (whose ward he had been); (2) in 1637 Cicely, daughter of Sir William Fisherwick, baronet, of Skeffington, Leicesterhire, widow of Edward Mytton of Weston, Staffordshire. Brereton was MP for Cheshire in 1624, 1628, and in the Short and Long Parliaments.<br/>Having failed in summer 1642 to seize Chester for parliament Brereton returned to London. He later recorded that he had first led his own troop at Brentford – by which he presumably meant not the engagement itself (on 12 Nov. 1642) but in the manoeuvres as the king’s approach threatened London. In Dec. he raised a number of dragoons. Brereton returned to Cheshire in Jan. 1643 leading 500 soldiers, and joined forces with 2,000 volunteers raised by five leading local gentry. He made Nantwich his headquarters and later was appointed commander-in-chief of parliamentarian forces in Cheshire, gaining further powers by ordinances of 9 Jan. and 15 Mar. 1643, and 26 Mar. and 7 May 1644. Brereton was exempted from the Self-Denying Ordinance in Feb. 1645 in order to bring to a successful conclusion the lengthy siege of Chester. His exemption was rescinded in June, when the city was still untaken, but reinstated that Sept. Having accepted the surrender of Chester on 1 Feb. 1646, in the spring Brereton advanced into the Midlands, in Staffordshire besieging Lichfield and the castles at Dudley and Tutbury. The castles fell quickly, Lichfield held out into July. Units under Brereton formed one of three task forces (with those of Colonels Thomas Morgan and John Birch) which together defeated the last royalist field army at Stow-on-the-Wold in Mar. 1646.<br/>Brereton was colonel of regiments of Cheshire horse and foot. (For his account of the history of these formations see Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 2, 204-5.) As a commander, he adopted a regional rather than just a county approach and thus repeatedly in 1643-5, once most of Cheshire was fairly secure, he dispatched some of his troops to support and to reinforce parliamentarian operations in neighbouring counties, including Lancashire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Montgomeryshire, Denbighshire and Flint., sometimes commanding his men in person, sometimes deploying one of his senior officers to lead them. In consequence, he often struggled with more localist or moderate parliamentarians in Cheshire and neighbouring counties (see Morrill, <emph type="i">Cheshire</emph>, 139-79; Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 1.11-25.2.13-25; Pennington and Roots, <emph type="i">Committee at Stafford</emph>, lxxiv-lxxxii). Brereton 'was involved in more than thirty engagements in which blood was shed, he stormed eleven garrisoned towns, and was on six battlefields in which more than 2,000 men were engaged – Middlewich and Hopton Heath (Mar. 1643), Middlewich (Dec. 1643), Nantwich (Jan. 1644), Montgomery (Sept. 1644), and Stow-on-the-Wold (Mar. 1646)’ (<emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>). His surviving letterbooks allow us to reconstruct his campaigns during the last eighteen months of the main civil war in great detail and provide a wealth of information.<br/>Once the main civil war was ended, Brereton became for a time a London-based politician, active in the Commons and, while he absented himself during the period of the regicide, he was a fairly active Rumper. He also acquired the former archbishop’s palace at Croydon, Surrey, which thenceforth became his main residence, and he played a minor role in Surrey administrative affairs during the 1650s. But despite his dominant position in Cheshire in 1642-6, he was never a real political heavyweight in parliament or on the national stage and his star quickly waned after the war. He lost some of his property but was otherwise unmolested at the Restoration and he died shortly afterwards at Croydon, presumably still there as a tenant of the new archbishop who had regained ownership of the palace.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>; <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>; Carr and Atherton<emph type="i">, Brereton Staffs</emph><emph type="i">.</emph>;<emph type="i"></emph> R.

It is possible that Richard Symonds may have confused the two men as he was making his notations some years later, although in different ways both identifications are problematic. Both were members of the Company of the Artillery Garden (now the Honourable Artillery Company).

John Bridges had been the second lord’s solicitor and was an executor of his will; his father and four brothers also served the Grevilles as legal advisers or estate managers’ (Hughes, <emph type="i">Warwickshire</emph><emph type="i">, </emph>178).<br/>Brother of William Bridges and Matthew Bridges.<br/>Captain in Lord Brooke’s regiment of foot in Essex’s Army by 5 Sept. 1642. He was made governor of Warwick Castle (probably from 30 Dec., but also he was probably involved in the castle’s garrison before then) and promoted major in late 1642 or early 1643. Bridges became governor of Warwick town and colonel of the Warwick foot from 1645, after Godfrey Bosvile had stood down under the Self-Denying Ordinance. In that capacity he maintained a correspondence with Sir Samuel Luke, governor of Newport Pagnell garrison, and many letters to and from Bridges survive in Luke’s letter books. Bridges’s accounts (largely for 31 Dec. 1644-18 Oct. 1646, and so omitting earlier service) record his commands as:<br/>Captain of a troop of harquebusiers, 5 Jan. 1644-22 Aug. 1646; major of foot and captain of a foot company, 31 Dec. 1644-17 Mar. 1645; colonel of a regiment of foot and captain of a foot company, 17 Mar. 1645-22 Aug. 1646; governor of Warwick Castle (to 22 Aug. 1646); governor of Warwick town, 28 June 1645-22 Aug. 1646.<br/>In Feb. 1643 Bridges was part of Brooke’s Army when it drove the royalists out of Stratford-upon-Avon. <emph type="i">A Letter from Collonell Bridges </emph>(1645) is his account of his routing of a force of marauding royalists from Prince Maurice’s army outside Warwick with a scratch force.<br/>Bridges’s period as governor led to charges of extensive plundering and kidnapping in both Warwickshire and Oxfordshire, and embezzlement, including withholding his men’s pay and making away with goods taken from the king’s baggage train before Edgehill. Eventually, in 1651, he was cleared and his claims that such goods as were taken had been used for his garrison accepted. Some of these accusations may have been politically motivated, and the subcommittee of accounts at Warwick, which entertained these complaints so intently, may have been encouraged by their hostility to him as a social upstart and as the county commitee’s candidate for Warwickshire in the recruiter election. Nevertheless, one of the main witnesses against him was Andrew Yarranton whose later career suggests his hostility to Bridges was personal and professional rather than political. Yarranton complained that when he confronted Bridges over the pay that he was withholding, Bridges cashiered him and put him under house arrest, but refused to allow him a court martial to clear his name. Yarranton claimed:<br/>‘That it was usuall maner of Colo. Bridges, that when any officer or souldier under him, were he never soe faithfull or valiant, came to demand his pay, he would not only check him for it, but also give him such harshe and discouraging language that most mens spirites could not beare it, and by that means many of them went away from his service in discontent and left their pay in his handes’ (TNA, SP28/253B). Moreover, Yarranton claimed that in the nine months that he served in Bridges’s troop, the latter had only once marched out with it, to join Waller at Cropredy Bridge (29 June 1644), when he had made his excuses and left. Bridges ‘stayed with his Troope till the Armyes faced one another, and he being then in the van of his Troope into battalia, he left his Troope before the fight began’; about four hours later his officers learnt that Bridges had ridden to Warwick (TNA, SP28/253B).<br/>In 1645 Bridges was unsuccessful in the recruiter election to the county seat, despite his troops’ intimidation of voters. One of their victims, who was imprisoned by them, later reflected how Bridges’s men had tried ‘by violence to wrest their voices from them’; Bridges was ‘no gentleman by birth, a man of mean fortune and of mean abilities to perform so great a trust’ (Hughes, <emph type="i">Warwickshire</emph>, 248).<br/>Bridges prospered, in both Worcestershire (where he was able to set up as a gentleman) and Ireland. He was MP for Worcestershire, 1654 and for counties Sligo, Roscommon and Leitrim, 1656. He supported the kingship petition addressed to Cromwell in 1657. In England he was a member of Richard Baxter’s congregation; Irish historians identify him as an Independent.<br/>In Dec. 1659 Bridges was a leading figure in the seizure of Dublin Castle which marked the beginning of the counter-revolution in Ireland, and by Mar. 1660 was talking to (the long royalist) Edward Massey who answered his anxieties about Charles II.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: Peacock, <emph type="i">Army lists</emph>, 34; TNA, SP28/2a/77, SP28/4/71-96, SP28/201, Part 2 (accounts); SP28/253B (esp. examination of Andrew Yarranton); Hughes, <emph type="i">Warwickshire, </emph>76, 178, 194n. 195-6, 199, 202, 215-6, 235, 243, 247-9, 253n., 270, 308, 340n., 353, 357; Clarke, <emph type="i">Prelude to Restoration</emph>, 109, 113n., 118, 121, 143, 153, 279; T.C.

During the second civil war he served alongside and under his friend John Lambert at the battle of Preston and siege of Pontefract. In 1649 he was given command as colonel of a northern regiment of foot which was on the New Model Army payroll. Although he did not support the regicide, had misgivings about the proposed English invasion of Scotland in 1650 and resigned his commission around that time, he broadly supported the various regimes of the 1650s, became colonel of a Yorkshire militia regiment and served as governor of Hull during the latter half of the decade, supporting both Major General Lilburne and his old friend John Lambert. He supported the Restoration, obtained a baronetcy and retained the extensive properties he had acquired in northern England; indeed, he gained a reputation for acquiring property both by purchase and through a string of marriages to often younger wives and he died a very wealthy man.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB</emph>; Jones, ‘War in the North’, 374-5; Hopper, ‘Yorkshire parliamentarians’, 118; Wanklyn, <emph type="i">New Model Army</emph>, I, 161.<br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Yorkshire; Northern Army (Lambert); New Model Army</emph></td></tr>

He may have been the John Bromhall, son of Robert Bromhall, baptised at Nantwich on 22 Mar. 1617/18.<br/>In Sept. 1642 Bromhall was a captain in John Hampden’s regiment of foot in the earl of Essex’s Army. He left Hampden’s regiment on 28 Nov. 1642 to join Sir William Brereton’s forces as captain of one of three companies of dragoons. Although Bromhall lost a number of his men for service in the Home Counties, he led the remainder to Cheshire, reaching Nantwich by 3 Feb. 1643. By his accounts, Bromhall was captain of a company of dragoons from 21 Nov. 1642 into Apr. 1644. He was an active officer. According to Thomas Malbon, Stafford was taken by surprise on 15 May 1643 by Brereton’s horse and dragoons largely by ‘the pollicey and manhood of Major Broomehall and a few other…without losse of any man.’ (<emph type="i">Cheshire tracts</emph>, 54). Bromhall was captured in a skirmish near Wem, Shropshire on 28 Sept. 1643 but was exchanged in Apr. 1644. In the meantime Brereton’s dragoon regiment had been disbanded, and so on 30 Apr. Bromhall was given command of a troop of horse with the rank of major. However, he did not regain his former prominence and resigned his commission in early Feb. 1645. That May Bromhall was a signatory to the anti-Brereton petition. Bromhall’s accounts show that his command was effectively being subsidised not only by himself but also by his widowed mother. On 5 Jan. 1647 a warrant was directed to pay Major John Broomhall and his mother &#xa3;306 out of sequestration money, to reimburse them for the expenditure from their estates in the public service: ‘unlesse the same bee repayd them they shall bee forced to sell that little Estate they have for the payment of those ingagements which lye upon them’ (TNA, SP28/224, f. 225). In Aug. 1650 Bromhall was commissioned major in Colonel Henry Brooke’s militia regiment of foot, but it is not known whether he fought with the regiment at Worcester the following year.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: TNA, SP28/2b/378, 701; SP28/3a/157; SP28/4/266; SP28/224, f. 225; BL, Harl. 2128, ff. 20-33; <emph type="i">Cheshire tracts</emph>, 54, 76, 77, 103; Dore, <emph type="i">Brereton letter books</emph>, 1. 352, 354, 2. 204-5; <emph type="i">CSPD, 1650</emph>, 509; Carr and Atherton<emph type="i">, Brereton Staffs</emph><emph type="i">.</emph><emph type="i">, </emph>303<emph type="i">.</emph><emph type="b"></emph><br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Earl of Essex; Cheshire</emph></td></tr>

However, Brooke rose to prominence in the war effort during 1644 after the battle of Nantwich, when he joined Sir William Brereton in London. An ordinance of 7 May 1644 made Brooke high sheriff of Cheshire and voted &#xa3;1,000 towards the completion of his regiment of foot and troop of horse. He was also a deputy-lieutenant and county committeeman. By Apr. 1645 Brooke’s regiment of foot was 570 strong and his troop formed part Sir William Brereton’s regiment of horse. Brooke’s brothers Richard and John were respectively lieutenant-colonel and captain in his regiment.<br/>Brooke remained High Sheriff into 1647, and politically, with some wavering, generally supported Brereton’s activism: ‘He was probably the leader of a middle group of Cheshire Parliamentarians poised between Brereton’s closest allies and his opponents led by the Booths’ (Carr and Atherton, <emph type="i">Brereton Staffordshire</emph>, 89). In July 1650 Brooke was commissioned colonel of a Cheshire militia regiment of foot. In 1654 he was MP for the county and in 1659 played a leading role in Booth’s Rising.

Sir Richard had helped secure East Cornwall for parliament before his death.<br/>Baptised 4 Nov. 1613 at Saltash. He married Anne, daughter of Sir John Wyndham of Orchard Wyndham, Somerset.<br/>Captain of a troop of horse in the earl of Essex’s Army by May 1643. He is identified as in Hans Behre’s regiment of horse in Essex’s Army in a pay warrant for Oct. 1643 and a note of Essex’s cavalry when the regiment mustered during the South West campaign of 1644, commanding a troop of 10 officers and 80 men.<br/>With Behre’s loss of command and the dissolution of Essex’s Army, Buller proposed that he take his troop and other forces to join Edward Massey at Gloucester. The Committee of Both Kingdoms backed the plan, commending him as a captain whose valour was well known. In Apr. 1645 Buller was duly ordered to lead the remnants of Hans Behre’s and John Dalbier’s regiments of horse, about 400 men, to reinforce Edward Massey’s Brigade in the West. He was promoted major at the same time. In May 1645, given the shrunken state of the regiments, the Committee of Both Kingdoms directed Massey to reduce them alongside his own regiment of horse into one regiment of 600 men, with Buller to remain as major. Buller had taken two regiments known for disorder and plunder to a brigade which had, or was to earn, the same reputation. He was expressly ordered to maintain good discipline on the march and ensure that the people where they came were not to be oppressed. Once arrived in the West, the Committee of Both Kingdoms ordered Buller to take care to regulate his troops, and Massey to inflict exemplary punishment on the worst offenders amongst Buller’s troopers, whose robbing, plundering, swearing, drunkenness and debauchery made them ‘now looked upon as the greatest enemies in those places they come’ (<emph type="i">CSPD, 1644-45</emph>, 561-2).<br/>Buller appears in pay records as lieutenant-colonel and captain of a troop of horse in the Massey Brigade in Aug.-Nov. 1645.<br/>Buller, now a colonel, was governor of the Scilly Isles from their capture in 1646 until he was taken prisoner when his officers and men seized the castle of St Mary for the king in Aug. 1648. They described him and Captain Augustine Nicoll as ‘gentlemen of honour and gallantry well meriting their command but tainted with a <emph type="i">[blank] </emph>from the wrong spring’, whilst the new royalist governor noted that all fitting kindness was being be shown them as gallant men (HMC, <emph type="i">Pepys manuscripts</emph>, 274, 230).<br/>Buller was living in London in Apr. 1654, when, by his own account to the authorities, one Dr Naudin came to his lodgings, and walking alone with him in St James’s Park, tried to draw him into a French conspiracy to assassinate Cromwell. In the intended ensuing chaos, as one commander after another rapidly failed, ‘all the common soldiers … and all other discontented persons’ would join with him. The flattery which Buller ascribed to Naudin is interesting both for implying that Buller was an experienced professional soldier and for its rhetoric:<br/>‘he began to praise and extol me with great admiration, admiring that a person of my quality and experience, with my travels and languages, and so great a soldier, and a person of so much courage and resolution, would suffer myself and services to be so slighted and abused, and myself and country to be enslaved; and that I would not think of a way to make me great, which was in my power to do; and how fit a person I was for it; expressing how much it was for God's glory, and freeing my country from this slavery they were now under, saying, Portugal, Naples, and divers others had thrown off their tyrants, and had and did keep their country ever since to themselves; and that it was in my power, not only to make myself great now, but to posterity for ever; and that I was not less in the world than any other, and had as much right for to govern as any man; and that giving liberty of conscience, I might be sure of all the Anabaptists, Levellers, and Independents would be for me, and stand to me, besides all discontented persons, and many presbyterians and cavaliers.’<br/>Nevertheless, and perhaps in part because of the information of conspiracy, within months Buller was given command of a regiment of foot in the expedition to the Caribbean. He was at odds with General Robert Venables. The scoutmaster, an ally of Venables, wrote of Buller that, ‘The gentleman himself is stout, loves applause and flattery, and if there be any persons that would seeme to disrelish our general proceedings, something he hath to say on their behalfs, and all the reason I could ever find, he judgeth himself the elder collonel’ (<emph type="i">Thurloe state papers</emph>, 3.159). Venables blamed Buller for disobeying orders by moving against San Domingo before the rest of the army had landed, and so marching into an ambush; claimed that the ill-disciplined plundering of his men had led other soldiers into another ambush and accused him of insubordination and conspiring against him with other discontented officers. Defending himself, Venables commented that Buller had, ‘never yet clear’d himself about the loss of Scilly’ (Venables, <emph type="i">Narrative</emph>, 93). Buller was sent back to England by the council of war in July 1655 to represent the state of the army to Cromwell, and when Venables himself attended Cromwell, he was told that Buller was its agent, not him.

The extent to which Bulstrode led it in person in the field is not clear, however, for early in 1643 he was appointed governor of Aylesbury and part of the regiment probably served under him there as a garrison force.

Indeed, it was as a daring naval commander rather than as a land-based officer that he contributed to the civil war. He initially fought for parliament, playing a prominent role in the capture of Southsea Castle and the recovery of Portsmouth in late summer 1642, before moving north to join his kinsman Sir Hugh Cholmley at Scarborough, where he oversaw the strengthening of the castle and the creation of a naval base. When Cholmley defected to the king in spring 1643, Bushell initially and with some success sought to retake Scarborough for parliament, but Cholmley persuaded him to come out for the king as well and to hold Scarborough in the royalist cause. Thereafter he was a firm royalist, leading destructive raids against parliamentarian vessels and supporting royalist ports and coastal towns, based for much of the war at Scarborough and after its loss in the Channel Islands, at Dunkirk and other French Channel ports. He was captured in 1648, held prisoner for nearly three years and then in spring 1651 was tried, convicted and executed for treason springing from his betrayal of Scarborough.<br/><emph type="b">References</emph>: <emph type="i">Oxford DNB.</emph><br/><emph type="b">Armies</emph>: <emph type="i">Hampshire; Yorkshire</emph></td></tr>
