The Cromwell Association Online Directory of Parliamentarian Army Officers , ed. Stephen K Roberts (2017), British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/cromwell-army-officers.

This resource contains the names of over 4,000 officers who served in the armies of Parliament during the first English civil war (1642-6), and in some cases subsequently. This alphabetical directory covers all regions of England and Wales and, while not claiming to be comprehensive, brings together in one place the largest listing of parliamentarian officers in service prior to the creation of the New Model Army in 1645. It has been funded and supported by the Cromwell Association, a membership society and registered charity, reg. no. 1132954.

Please note that the XML was converted from docx format. This means that formatting elements such as bold, ```<emph type="b">``` and italic, ```<emph type="i">``` can interpose in the middle of strings, including words. For counting strings it is therefore advisable to delete these elements first.
